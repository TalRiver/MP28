<h2>Winter In Israel</h2>

<p class="summer" > <strong>The Winter Weather In Israel</strong> is mild with sunshine and only the occasional light rain. The wettest period is from December to February when there is still plenty of sunshine but sporadic heavy downpours. Average temperatures go from 12°C-24°C in November and 9°C-18°C in December to 8°C-18°C in January and February.
</p> <p>Daily sunlight hours are between 7 and 9. Israel winter weather is still perfect for outdoor sightseeing but perhaps not the best weather if you want a beach holiday. The weather also varies from city to city. In cities with high elevation like Jerusalem and Safed the weather is colder and you might even see snow in December or January. In the south and along the coast temperatures are mild during the day with cooler weather in the evenings.</p>

<p>As with all winter travel you will get the lowest prices on flights and hotels (so long as you avoid any national or school holidays). You will also avoid the summer tourist crowds. Israel has several exciting holidays and special events in winter including many music festivals. You could time your visit in December to join in the Hanukah celebrations or spend Christmas Eve in Bethlehem. Nature lovers can see the Judea, Galilee and Golan Heights in full bloom in February when wildflowers cover the hills. If you visit Israel in winter you may be able to ski at Israel’s only ski resort on </p>

<p>Don’t load up your back with heavy winter wear. You may need a sweatshirt or light sweater for the daytime while in the evening when the temperatures drop you may want something a little warmer like a light jacket or fleece. No need for thermal underwear or heavy winter coats even if you are traveling to the coldest parts of the country. Some winter days are even hot enough for shorts! During the day you will be comfortable in a long or short sleeve T-shirt and pants. Make sure you have a light raincoat incase of rain and your swimming costume incase the weather warms up enough for a swim. Winter in Israel is shoe weather rather than sandals weather. The best recommendation is to pack so that you can dress in layers and peel off your warmer top layer when the sun shines.</p>
