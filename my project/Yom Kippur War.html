<h2> <ins>The Primary Causes To The War:</ins> </h2>

<div>
<p>  <span> <strong>The Yom Kippur War</strong> </span>  is known as the most difficult war we have ever known in the Land of Israel, the receipt of intelligence, judgment, and the prevention of war are still subject to controversy by the public, the command, and the soldiers (at the time).
</p>
<p> Immediately after the defeat of the Arab states in 1967, the leaders of the Arab countries left the Conference of Khartoum in Sudan in August 1967 to discuss the continuation of the plans for the defeat of the State of Israel. The conference can be summed up by agreeing on the three no-no negotiations with Israel, Rather than recognition of Israel. Arab honor was humiliated after all the arrogant words of the leaders of the Arab people and especially of Nasser on their great power and their readiness to "throw the Jews into the sea" and conquer the land of Israel, the Syrian Egyptians and Jordanians were severely beaten in this war and therefore the State of Israel should have a more strict approach The Arab states.	
It did not happen, the mood in the State of Israel in the Supreme Command mainly had an all-powerful atmosphere, the Arabs were just cowards, they would take off their shoes and run, no one could face our air force, etc. ... What actually happened was exactly the opposite: the Syrians and the Egyptians rearmed With sophisticated equipment, very smart and modern from the Soviets, rebuilding the armies, cooperation with Soviet consultants, etc.
</p>
<p>As early as May 1973, a warning arrived for the war. Nasser's groom (who has already died) Ashraf Marwan is still in a respectable role in Egypt's rise, sharing secrets in every Egyptian process, making contact with Israel and starting to cooperate.
Commanders believe in the Mossad and recruit reserve soldiers on alert for war. Time goes by the economy is eroded, a large mobilization of reserve duty is very expensive business and there is no evidence on the horizon of war, the institution loses its word and the army is back to normal. a few months before the start of the war, reports are being received from the field about the movement of war tools, missiles, bridging devices in the Golan Heights, and means of crossing over the Canal. The command is once again ignored. Intelligence soldiers repeatedly warn of critical events, for example the return of all the families of the Soviet advisors back to the Soviet Union An almost unequivocal thing for war, the demotion of the fortified 47th Brigade The T-64 tanks are a war because this is a brigade whose job it is to defend the regime. And of course the Israeli Supreme Command always said in the summation of things "they have no chance"

<h2> <ins>The War:</ins> </h2>
<div>
<p>On October 6, 1973 at 14:00 the war opens on two fronts simultaneously, in the Golan Heights and in the Suez Canal, most of the IDF forces on the ground are soldiers of the regular army who can not stop the massive offensive by the Arab enemy.
Fortunately for Israel, the war began on Yom Kippur when the roads were empty and reservists were at home, and the mobilization of the reserves quickly reached the fronts and prevented the fall of additional lines of defense.
The Arab idea was to cause the IDF to split up and fight on two fronts, and not like in the Six Day War when the IDF won each army separately, It was very challenging for the Israeli army.
</p>
<p>Moshe Dayan, who was so proud of his victory six years earlier, said "the destruction of the Third Temple." This only shows that anyone who was with his nose up after the Six-Day War returned quickly to the ground. The IDF quickly balanced against the surprise attack. The fighting was very difficult at first. The IDF lost the Hermon base, which was the most sensitive intelligence post at that time, which caused many plans to be canceled. In addition, the Israeli air force was not prepared for the SA-300 air defense of the Syrians and Egyptians, and it also suffered very serious losses. Without the air force, the ground forces could not continue the attack,

<h3><ins>The Northern Front:</ins></h3>
</div>
<p id="white">On the northern front, three Syrian divisions of mechanized infantry attacked the Golan Heights (including about 800 tanks) and 1,200 artillery barrels along the Syrian-Israeli border. In front of them were two armored brigades (188th, which was deployed along the border and the 7th brigade), two infantry battalions under the command of the 820th line brigade, whose headquarters was in volume, and 44 artillery pieces. In contrast to Egypt, which focused on the occupation of all the outposts, the Syrians skipped the outposts and moved deep into the area. The Israeli Hermon outpost, which served as an important observation post for intelligence and the air force, fell into the hands of a Syrian commando force, which landed from four helicopters, most of which arrived on foot from the Syrian Hermon.
</p>
<p id="white">While in the northern part of the Golan Heights the Syrians were stopped, in the southern and central sector of the Golan Heights, the Syrian brigades managed to cross the purple line. The Syrians launched another armored division in the Kudna area, and penetrated into the central part of the Golan Heights, to the area of ​​Hoshenia and Naaf. In the southern part, the Syrians advanced to the Jordan crossings and reached the El-Al area. Another force came to the area of ​​Gamla, 7 km from the Kinneret water, where it was destroyed On October 7, the order was issued to prepare the bridges of the Jordan to explode.The Americans pressed King Hussein of Jordan not to participate in the war,
And in a crucial decision it was decided to leave the border with Jordan almost unprotected, and to raise the 146th Division under the command of Moshe Peled to the Golan Heights. While Division 36 under the command of Rafael Eitan blocked the Syrians in the northern sector, in the center of the sector, Division 210 fought under the command of Major General Dan Lerner. In the evening the Syrians were stopped. The Air Force failed to attack the surface-to-air missile batteries in Operation Dogman-5.</p>
<p id="white">
On October 11, the IDF launched an offensive eastward across the Syrian border, Division 36 and Division 210 headed towards Damascus and managed to occupy an area of ​​about 400 square kilometers. On October 12, forces from the Iraqi Expeditionary Force, which forced the IDF to stop the attack, joined the fighting and Damascus airport airfields were shelled by IDF and air force artillery. The IDF positioned itself in an enclave that was captured by the Syrians, while fighting Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian forces, and on 12 October and 22 October, a Golani Brigade force captured the Hermon position, two battalions from the Paratroopers Brigade 317 Hutsu On the day of the Syrian Hermon and captured it on the night of 21-22 of the month.
</p>

<h3><ins>The South Front:</ins></h3>
<p>
The southern front stood opposite the Suez Canal, two armies comprising about 1,700 tanks and 2,000 artillery barrels. Five Egyptian infantry divisions were deployed along the eastern shore of the canal, with a width of 3 to 4 kilometers. With water cannon bursting from sections of the earth embankment on the Israeli side of the canal. The attack was carried out under cover of surprise, and therefore the attacking forces did not encounter any real resistance from the IDF.
</p>
In front of the Egyptian forces was a Sinai division with seven artillery batteries, with only one tank division (the 14th Brigade) parked on the line of the Suez Canal and 457 fighters in 20 strongholds at the front. Another 200 tanks of Division 252 were in Sinai, but they were too far away to respond quickly. The pigeons' defense program, which was supposed to jump the armored brigade to defend the strongholds, was not activated in time, and in practice only one tank managed to reach the stronghold of Budapest while it was in a position to defend it. <br>	The Egyptians also carried a number of commando battalions into Sinai in helicopters and boats to disrupt the reinforcements, but the Egyptian commando operation was a total failure.
<p>
On October 7, a day after the start of the war, began arriving in the reserve forces and imposed Israeli campaign in three divisions: Avraham Adan's division was stationed on the northern front, Sharon's division in central and regular Chinese division of Albert Mandler southern sector. The three divisions managed to stabilize a line of braking along the Hattam route about 10 kilometers east of the Canal. On October 8 a gradual counterattack by the two divisions began, first in the north and then in the center. This attack failed, and Division 162 suffered heavy losses. The head of the government, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan prevented to speak to the nation and to present the situation. Until October 9 collapsed Bar-Lev line except bastion Budapest (left by Israel and by the end of the war) and placed in the dock (dock personnel stationed surrendered on October 13, 1973). On October 10, former chief of staff Haim Bar-Lev received command of the front,Because of the failures of GOC Southern Command Shmuel Gonen (Gorodish), who became his deputy.
</p>
Armored forces of two Egyptian divisions crossed the canal. On October 14, contrary to the opinion of the Egyptian chief of staff and pressure from Syria, the Egyptians launched an offensive along the front with the aim of penetrating deep into Sinai, and in effect the Egyptian forces went through a mobile attack, forcing them to leave most of the air defense forces behind. To air strikes in light of the superiority of the Israeli air force in the Sinai, and indeed, the ground forces of the IDF, with the extensive assistance of the air force, halted this attack and the armor of October 14. The Egyptians lost 300 tanks in this operation, as opposed to 20 tanks that were lost to the IDF. This defeat of the Egyptians gave a green light to the opening of the IDF in the attack.
<p>
On October 15, an IDF operation began to cross the Suez Canal, and a reconnaissance battalion from Sharon's division identified the seam line between the two armies, thus creating a situation that allowed access to the canal without conducting an entrance battle. The Sharon division and the engineering forces of the Southern Command, which established a bridgehead by moving forces in rubber boats and "Teamsahim" north of the Great Bitter Lake.
In the end, two divisions crossed the Canal (towards Egypt), the Adan Division and the Sinai Division, with the Sharon Division advancing north on both banks of the canal. The divisions took over 1,600 square kilometers on the West Bank of the Suez Canal. On October 22, the IDF cross off the Cairo-Suez road, and the third Egyptian army, located east of the Suez Canal, was surrounded by two of the divisions under double encirclement and left without supply. After the depth of the IDF's penetration into Egypt became apparent, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat dismissed Egyptian Chief of Staff Saad al-Shazli.

<h2><ins>The Results Of The War:</ins></h2>	
<p> Most historians claim that since the war ended with Israeli military supremacy - in stopping the Egyptians in the Canal Zone, in an Israeli incursion into the west, when there is no significant Egyptian force between the IDF and Cairo, the second and third Armistice encirclement (which means that their military and historical impact on the territory is not large and considered defeated) ) Of the Egyptians, who constituted about two-thirds of the Egyptian army, achieved naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, the dismissal of Egyptian Chief of Staff Sa'ad Azzali during the war, the Soviet threat to send an army, the Egyptian request to intervene in their favor, By the Egyptian army, which was in bad shape, it was Israel is the victor in the war. </p> <p> In terms of long-term achievements, there are those who claim an Israeli victory. For example, Col. Benny Michelson claims that following the war, the Egyptians understood that even in the most successful opening conditions, they could not destroy Israel and consequently agreed to direct negotiations with Israel, which he said they had not previously agreed to. Has for the past 40 years tried to launch a systematic attack against Israel.</p>

<p>The peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, which was signed following the war, led to the fact that for decades, even after the regime change in Egypt, Egypt ceased to pose a military threat to Israel.
